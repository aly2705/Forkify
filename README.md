# Forkify v2
Forkify v2 is an improved version of the modern frontend application built in Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript Course. 
You can search over 1m recipes, bookmark them, add new ones, create a downloadable shopping list and plan your meals for the week with this version of the app. Completely responsive and ready to be used!
